# Pose Detection Project using OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project detects human poses in real-time using OpenCV and Google's MediaPipe library. The implementation runs on a Raspberry Pi 4 but is also compatible with other systems with Python installed.

## Features
- Real-time pose detection
- Uses MediaPipe for efficient pose estimation
- Visualizes pose landmarks on the screen

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your Raspberry Pi 4 (or other system):
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aditi-Deo/pose-detection-project.git
   cd pose-detection-project
